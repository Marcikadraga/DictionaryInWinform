# DictionaryInWinform
#### Description:   
This is my hobby project an eng-hun dictionary winforms application.  
In this application you can add english and hungarian word pairs,   
sentences, or .srt/.txt files to the database easily.
In this project I practised:  
-serialisation,  
-add data to database,  
-work with winforms.  
<img src="imgs/Dictionary.png" width=75% height=75%>
<img src="imgs/Settings.png"   width=75% height=75%>
#### Usage:  
There are two ways to add words to the database:  
-You can add word pairs manually,  
-You can add / paste words, senteces or drag and drop txt. or srt. files in the richTextBox.  
If you click on the save button the program will check if the database  
contains these english words before adding,so every english word will be uniq.  
There is a settings button below, cick on it you can serialize and import  
your words of database to .txt, .xml, .json.  
Feel free to use it.  
#### Installation:  
The code is open source ,you can clone the repository and use it.
